A little bee sat on binary tree
Code flowers spread as far as eye can see
To bad one can't recall terminal commands from memory

Start small, and let each commit build on the last.
Learning to navigate through errors is just part of the process.
Keep experimenting, and soon the commands will feel like second nature
